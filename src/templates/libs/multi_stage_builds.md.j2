# Multi-stage Builds

Reduce image size and separate build/runtime steps using multi-stage Docker builds.

Example Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Runtime stage
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Notes:
- Keep runtime images minimal.
- Use named stages to copy artifacts only.
