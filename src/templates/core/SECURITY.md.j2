## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within **{{ project_name | default("this project") }}**, please do not open a public issue on GitHub.

Instead, please send an email to **security@example.com** (replace with actual email).

We will try to review your report within 48 hours and provide a fix as soon as possible.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### OWASP Top 10 Considerations

This project follows security best practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities:

1. **Injection**: Use parameterized queries and input validation.
2. **Broken Authentication**: Implement secure session management and password policies.
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Disable XML external entity processing.
5. **Broken Access Control**: Implement proper authorization checks.
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Keep dependencies updated and use secure defaults.
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Sanitize user input and use Content Security Policy.
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Regularly update dependencies.
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Log security events and monitor for anomalies.

### Dependency Management

{% if tech_stack | default("") and ("Node" in tech_stack or "React" in tech_stack or "Next" in tech_stack) %}
- Regularly run `npm audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies.
- Use `npm audit fix` to automatically fix vulnerabilities where possible.
- Consider using Dependabot or Snyk for automated dependency updates.
{% elif tech_stack | default("") and ("Python" in tech_stack or "FastAPI" in tech_stack or "Django" in tech_stack) %}
- Use `pip-audit` or `safety` to check for vulnerable packages.
- Keep `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` dependencies up to date.
- Consider using Dependabot for automated dependency updates.
{% endif %}

### Authentication & Authorization

- Use strong password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2).
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Store tokens securely (httpOnly cookies for web, secure storage for mobile).

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest.
- Use HTTPS/TLS for data in transit.
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to version control.
- Use environment variables or secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).

### Input Validation

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use type-safe schemas (Pydantic, Zod, Joi) for validation.
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information.
