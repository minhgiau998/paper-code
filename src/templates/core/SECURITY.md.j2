## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within **{{ project_name }}**, please do not open a public issue on GitHub.

Instead, please send an email to **security@example.com** (replace with actual email).

We will try to review your report within 48 hours and provide a fix as soon as possible.
