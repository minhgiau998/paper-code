# Deployment Guide

## 🌍 Environments

- **Development**: Local machine or dev branch.
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for final QA.
- **Production**: Live environment.

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline
We use (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI) to automate deployment.

**Workflow:**
1. Push to `main` triggers the build pipeline.
2. Unit tests and linting checks are run.
3. If successful, the artifact is built (Docker image / Static assets).
4. The artifact is deployed to the target provider.
