# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are an AI programming assistant working on the **{{ project_name }}** project.

## 🧠 Tech Stack Profile
- **Language:** {{ tech_stack }}
- **Type System:** {% if "TypeScript" in libraries %}TypeScript{% else %}Standard{% endif %}
- **Architecture:** {{ project_type }}

## 📝 Coding Guidelines

1. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Adhere strictly to the conventions defined in `docs/CODE_STANDARDS.md`.
   - Variables: camelCase (JS/TS), snake_case (Python/Rust).
   - Components/Classes: PascalCase.

2. **Preferred Libraries:**
   {% if libraries %}
   You should prioritize using the following installed libraries over native solutions or other 3rd party packages:
   {% for lib in libraries %}
   - **{{ lib }}**
   {% endfor %}
   {% endif %}

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Always implement defensive programming.
   - Use `try/catch` (JS) or `try/except` (Python) blocks for side-effects.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Add JSDoc/Docstrings to all exported functions and classes.

## 🚫 Constraints
- Do not generate deprecated code (e.g., Class Components in React, `var` in JS).
- Do not hallucinate imports. Only import from installed packages listed in `package.json` or `requirements.txt`.
