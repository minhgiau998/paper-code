# React Project Architecture

## 🏗️ High-Level Overview

This project is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React.
{% if "TypeScript" in libraries or "TypeScript Lib" in libraries %}
It utilizes **TypeScript** for type safety and scalability.
{% endif %}

The architecture follows a **Feature-based** (or Domain-driven) structure rather than a purely technical structure. This ensures that code related to a specific feature stays together.

## 🧩 Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Feature Slices
Code is organized by **Feature**, not by file type.
- **Bad:** `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`, `src/actions/authActions.ts`
- **Good:** `src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`, `src/features/auth/api/auth.ts`

### 2. Component Composition
We favor composition over inheritance.
- Use `children` prop to pass content into wrappers.
- Use **Layout Components** to manage page structures.

### 3. State Management Strategy
{% if "Redux Toolkit" in libraries %}
- **Global Server State:** Managed by **Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)** or separate query library.
- **Global UI State:** Managed by **Redux Slices**.
- **Local State:** `useState` or `useReducer` for form inputs/toggles.
{% elif "Zustand" in libraries %}
- **Global State:** Managed by **Zustand** stores. Keep stores small and focused.
- **Local State:** `useState`.
{% elif "TanStack Query" in libraries %}
- **Server State:** Strictly managed by **TanStack Query**. Do not store API data in global context manually.
- **Client State:** React Context or `useState`.
{% else %}
- **Global State:** React Context API (use sparingly for theme/auth).
- **Local State:** `useState` / `useReducer`.
{% endif %}

### 4. Data Fetching
{% if "Axios" in libraries %}
- All API calls are abstracted in `src/lib/axios.ts` or feature-specific `api/` folders.
- Components never call `fetch` or `axios` directly; they call a Hook or Service function.
{% else %}
- API calls are encapsulated in custom hooks (e.g., `useFetchData`).
